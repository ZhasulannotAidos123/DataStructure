1) Using linked list in stack is better idea than using array because , linked list based stack using memory more efficient , becuse it doesn need any buffer
2) In queque i used the same logic , whhich i used in stack , the linked list provide me efficient way using memory
3) In minheap i use array, becouse it provide easyer way to get object in compare with linkedlist , and also i dont need store three pointers for eaxh element in heap
